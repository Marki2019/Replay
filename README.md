# Replay Design

This is a repository in which the different mockups that will be used during the development of [Replay](https://github.com/nahuelwexd/Replay) will be published, for each of its screens and sections. It is also the place where all discussions related to the app design should take place.

## Goals for the design

- Must have variants for large, medium and small screens (mobile)

- Must adhere to [GNOME Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable)

- Should be self-explanatory and only provide a short text in case there's some not so obvious interaction that needs to be explained

- Editable files must be an SVG file and be inside the `src/` folder, exported PNG files must be in the repository root.
