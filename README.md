# Replay Design

This is a repository in which the different mockups that will be used during the development of [Replay](https://github.com/nahuelwexd/Replay) will be published, for each of its screens and sections. It is also the place where all discussions related to the app design should take place.

## Goals for the design

- Should be simple and comfortable to use

- Should be friendly with trackpads and touchscreens

- Should be adaptive, for different form factors

- Must feel familiar to current YouTube users

- Must follow the [GNOME Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.gnome.org/hig/stable)
