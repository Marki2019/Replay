![UI Mockup](ui-mockup.png)

> **IMPORTANT:** This project is work in progress. It's still in very early stages of development and isn't ready for use.

Replay is a brand new app for GNOME, intended to be a fast and all-proof YouTube client for laptops and phones. You can use it to see the latest videos of your subscriptions, search for others using the search that will be integrated in the header bar, manage your playlists and explore the latest trends in your region.

## Install

### Stable

Since this project is still under active development, there's no current stable build. You'll see a Flathub badge here when there's one.

### Development

Development builds are automatically generated every time a new change lands on the `master` branch, and are marked with a custom icon and style. You can install a development build simply by going to the [actions](https://github.com/nahuelwexd/Replay/actions) tab of this repository, and downloading one of those that have been successfully generated.

> **NOTE:** You must download the artifact called "Flatpak Bundles", which contains 2 flatpak files ready to install: the application and the locales.
