# Contributing to this repo

Hey! Thanks for your interest in contributing! 😃️

Below you will find a series of guides for each way of contributing, be sure to read them before doing anything

## Discussing new ideas for the design

If you have new ideas for the application, such as new sections or ideas to make the application more handy, you can suggest them with an issue, where you should explain your idea as widely as possible. Check if your idea has not been previously suggested before opening the issue.

## Contributing with mockups

To contribute to this repository with new mockups or corrections to existing ones, you must abide by the following conventions:

- All mockups must be SVG files, preferably editable with Inkscape

- They must be found in the `src/` folder. If there're several files and they're strictly related, you can create a subfolder for them.

- You must provide a PNG version of them (File > Export PNG Image... in Inkscape)

- The PNG version of the mockups must be in the root of the repository. Again, if there are several files and they are strictly related, you can create a subfolder for them

- The mockups must be placed on a white sheet with 30 mm margin, which must contain the title of the design and (optionally) a short text explaining not so obvious interactions

- All the images that the mockup requires must be embedded in the SVG file
